**Project Overview**

This project involves the analysis of coffee shop sales data with the aim of providing actionable insights to improve customer experience and sales performance. The analysis was conducted using historical sales data, customer preferences, and location-based performance metrics.

**Data Overview**

The dataset includes sales transactions, customer preferences, time-of-day, and location-specific data. Key metrics include:

Product Sales: Espresso drinks, brewed teas, gourmet coffee, etc.

Time of Sale: Data points around peak times, busy days, etc.

Location Performance: Sales per location and footfall information.

**Key Findings**

**1. Top Products**

Barista Espresso drinks lead in sales.

Followed by Brewed Teas and Gourmet Coffee.

Actionable Insight: Focus on inventory for the top-selling products to avoid shortages and optimize stock management.

**2. Peak Times and Days**

The busiest times are midweek around lunchtime, with notable spikes in mornings and late afternoons.

Customer traffic follows typical weekday routines and work schedules.

Actionable Insight: Increase staffing and resources during peak hours, especially around mid-morning and lunch breaks.

**3. Location Performance**

Hell's Kitchen and Astoria show the highest footfall and sales.

Lower Manhattan has potential for growth, indicating a gap in foot traffic or untapped opportunities.

Actionable Insight: Target marketing or promotions at Lower Manhattan and consider expanding inventory in high-performing locations.

**4. Customer Preferences**

Coffee remains the favorite, with significant demand for Tea and Bakery Items.

Actionable Insight: Diversify offerings to cater to preferences for tea and bakery items.

**Recommendations**

Increase staffing during peak hours to ensure smooth service and customer satisfaction.

Target promotions during weekdays, particularly around mid-morning, when sales are likely to be higher.

Expand high-footfall locations (Hell's Kitchen and Astoria) with additional stock and consider setting up new locations in underperforming areas like Lower Manhattan.

**Conclusion**

This analysis has provided actionable insights that can directly influence the coffee shop's customer experience and sales performance. By focusing on inventory optimization, targeted promotions, and strategic staffing, the coffee shop can see improved performance in both high-traffic and underserved locations.
